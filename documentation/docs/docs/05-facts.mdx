# Facts

Facts are essentially variables. They store information that can be modified by other entries. All facts are numbers and are treated as such.

:::info
Facts are stored per player, not for the server or world, unless otherwise specified.
:::

The [`Basic Adapter`](../adapters/BasicAdapter) encompasses numerous facts available for use. However, it's important to note that [`adapters`](adapters) have the capability to further augment the array of available facts.

## Why Use Facts?

Facts play a crucial role in dynamic content creation and system behavior customization. Here are some reasons to consider using facts:

- **Dynamic Quests:** Track player progress in quests by using facts to store and modify completion status.

- **Customization:** Personalize player experiences by utilizing facts to adjust in-game parameters, such as difficulty levels or character attributes.

- **Interactive Storytelling:** Enhance narrative elements by employing facts to remember player choices and actions, shaping the evolving story.

- **Achievement Systems:** Implement achievement tracking by using facts to record specific milestones and accomplishments.

### types of facts
Facts have 2 types Readable and Writable.
- **Readable Facts:** Used in the criteria of an entry. For example, checking if a player has a certain item in their inventory.
- **Writable Facts:** Used in modifiers to modify the fact's value. For instance, updating a player's quest progression.

:::warning
Not all facts are both readable and writable; some are read-only.

### Criteria

Criteria is the condition for an action, e.g., `if fact = 10 then...`. It controls whether an action will occur.

![Criterion Fields](./assets/facts/criteria.png)

When using Criteria, follow these steps:
1. Select the fact to check.
2. Choose the operator.
3. Insert the value for the operator to check.

### Modifiers

Modifiers, as the name suggests, modify a fact.

![Modifier Fields](./assets/facts/modifier.png)

When using Modifiers, follow these steps:
1. Select the fact to modify.
2. Choose the operator. You can change the value directly (=) or add to it (+).
3. Insert the value for the operator to modify.
:::warning
Modifiers only run if the entry is executed. If the entry isn't run, the fact won't be modified.
If the entry has criteria, and the criteria is false, the fact won't be modified.

## Tutorial
To get your started with facts we will use a permanent fact to track progression in a quest.

1. Create a new page and select it as static. Give it the name `Playerprogress`
2. click on the + icon and select `Add Permanent Fact`. Rename it to `Playerprogress` and give it a nice comment.
![Static Page Button](./assets/facts/static-page.png)
3. Now in a sequance page click on an action.
   - Set a **Criteria:** Check if `Playerprogress` == 0.
   - Set a **Modifier:** If criteria are met, update `Playerprogress` to 1.
4. Create additional actions to represent different quest stages, modifying `Playerprogress` accordingly.
