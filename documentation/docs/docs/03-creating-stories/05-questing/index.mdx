# Questing

Any interactive storytelling game is going to have quests. 
Quests are meant to be a way to guide the player through the story, and to give them a sense of progression.

In Typewriter, quests are purely a visual addition.
They are not required to make interactive stories, but they can be a way to guide the player through the story.

## Setting up the story

To add quests to your story, we first need to have a story to add quests to.
For this guide will make the following quest:

1. The player finds a chasm where the wind is to strong to walk across the bridge.
2. The player needs to find a way to cross the chasm.
3. The player finds magnet boots close by.
4. When the player is wearing the magnet boots, the player can walk across the chasm.

The following is the setup for the quest:

<EntryDisplay pages={[
    require("./assets/index/setup_manifest.json"),
    require("./assets/index/setup_sequence.json"),
]} />

Here is a demo of the setup described above:
<Player url={require("./assets/index/setup_demo.webm").default} />
