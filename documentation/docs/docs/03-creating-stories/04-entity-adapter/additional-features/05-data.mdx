# Setting the entity's data
If you want to give the entity some custom data,
you can do that by adding a data field and adding the data you want to link with the entity.
You can add as many data fields as you want.
IMPORTANT: Data is affected by the priority of the data field.
If you have multiple data fields with the same name, the one with the highest priority will be used in case of a conflict.
You can also add data to the entity instance.
This data is specific to that NPC instance and will not affect the definition, but only that instance.
You can reuse entity definitions and their data across multiple instances.

You can find a list of all the data fields in the [Data Fields](../../../../adapters/EntityAdapter/EntityAdapter.mdx#datas) section.
