Having problems with adapters? Check the steps here to insure you have set them up correctly

## Not in correct folder.
The adapter needs to be placed in a folder called "adapters" within the plugin directory `/plugins/Typewriter/adapters`. Create one if it does not excist.

## Old-version
When installing a new typewriter.jar ensure that you also update all the adapters otherwise they may brake.
