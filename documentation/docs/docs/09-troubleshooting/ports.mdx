title: Panel Loading/Saving Issues
---

Encountering difficulties with the panel not loading or saving? Follow these steps to ensure correct setup:

## No Ports Assigned
If the panel isn't loading, it's possible you haven't assigned any ports to the plugin. Ensure proper functionality by allocating 2 open ports for the plugin: one for the panel to load and another for the websocket to communicate with the server.
:::info
Hosting platforms like Aternos only offer 1 port, so saidly the plugin will not work on those types of hostings.
:::

## Incorrect URL
Ensure you are connecting via the correct URL. Use `ip:port` or, if using a subdomain, `url:port`.
