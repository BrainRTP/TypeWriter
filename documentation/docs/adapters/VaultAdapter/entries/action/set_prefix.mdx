# Set Prefix Action

The `Set Prefix Action` action sets the prefix of a player's message

## How could this be used?

This could be used for a badge system. When a player completes a certain task, like killing a boss, they could be given a prefix that shows up in chat, like `[Deamon Slayer]`

## Fields

<ActionsField/>

<EntryField name="Prefix" required>
    The prefix to set.
</EntryField>
