# Basic Adapter

The Basic Adapter contains all the essential entries for Typewriter. In most cases, it should be installed with Typewriter. If you haven't installed Typewriter or the adapter yet, please follow the [Installation Guide](../docs/installation-guide) first.

## Entries

All entries have a `triggers` field which is what entries will be triggered after the current entry is finished. This field can be a single entry or a list of entries.

### Events

When something happens. The player that triggers the event is passed through all other triggers connected to it.
