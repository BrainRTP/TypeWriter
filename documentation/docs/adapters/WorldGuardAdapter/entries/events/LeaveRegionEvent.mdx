# Leave Region Event

The `Leave Region Event` is triggered when a player leaves a region.

## How could this be used?

This event could be used to trigger a message when a player leaves a region, and give them a farewell message.
Or if you wanted to make a region that is a "safe zone" where players can't be attacked, you could use this event to trigger a message when a player leaves the region.

## Fields

<EventsField/>

<EntryField name="Region" required>
    The region the player must leave to trigger the event.
</EntryField>
