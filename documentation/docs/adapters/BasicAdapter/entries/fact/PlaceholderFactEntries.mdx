# Placeholder Fact Entries

Computed Facts are facts that are computed from a placeholder. They are useful for things like player level, or if you want to use a placeholder from another plugin.

## How could this be used?

This could be used to get the player's level, and store it in a fact so that you can use it from anywhere as criteria.

## Fields

<FactsField />

<EntryField name="Placeholder" required placeholder>
    Placeholder to use for the fact. The placeholder must return a number or boolean.
</EntryField>
