# Value Placeholder Fact

A [fact](/docs/facts) that is computed from a placeholder.
This placeholder is evaluated when the fact is read and can return anything. The value will be computed based on the `values` specified.
<ReadonlyFactInfo/>

## How could this be used?

If you only want to run certain actions if the player is in creative mode. Or depending on the weather, change the dialogue of an NPC.

## Fields

<EntryField name="Placeholder" required placeholder>
    Placeholder to use for the fact. The placeholder must return a number or boolean.
</EntryField>

<EntryField name="Values" required multiple regex>
    Values to use for the placeholder. The placeholder will be evaluated with these values. And the value of the
    fact will be the value of the first entry that matches.
