# Detect Command Ran Event

The `Detect Command Ran Event` event is triggered when an **already existing** command is ran.

:::caution
This event only works if the command already exists. If you are trying to make a new command that does not exist already, use the [`Run Command Event`](RunCommandEvent) instead.
:::

## How could this be used?

This event could be used to trigger a response when a specific command is ran. For example, you could have a command that sends a message to a channel when a command is ran, which could be used as an audit log for your admins.

## Fields

<EventsField />

<EntryField name="Command" required regex>
    The command that was ran. Can be a regular expression.
</EntryField>
