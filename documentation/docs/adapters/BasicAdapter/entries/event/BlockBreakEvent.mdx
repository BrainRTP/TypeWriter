# Block Break Event

The `Block Break Event` is triggered when a player breaks a block.

## How could this be used?

This could allow you to make custom ores with custom drops, or make custom blocks that can only be broken with a specific item.

## Fields

<EventsField />

<EntryField name="Location" optional>
    The location of the block that was broken.
</EntryField>

<EntryField name="Item In Hand" optional>
    The item the player must be holding when the block is broken.
</EntryField>

<EntryField name="Block" optional>
    The block that was broken.
</EntryField>
