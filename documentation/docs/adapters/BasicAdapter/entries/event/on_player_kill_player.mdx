# Player Kill Player Event

The `Player Kill Player Event` is triggered when a player kills another player. If you want to detect when a player kills some thing else, use the [`Player Kill Entity Event`](on_player_kill_entity) instead.

## How could this be used?

This could be used to create a bounty system, where someone places a bounty on another player, and when that player is killed, the bounty is paid out to the player who kills them.

## Fields

<EventsField />

<EntryField name="Target Triggers" required multiple>
    The triggers to be executed for the player who was killed.
</EntryField>
