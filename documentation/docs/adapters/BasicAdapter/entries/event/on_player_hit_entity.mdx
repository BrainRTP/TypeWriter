# Player Hit Entity Event

The `Player Hit Entity Event` event is fired when a player hits an entity. If you want to detect when a player kills an entity, use the [`Player Kill Entity Event`](on_player_kill_entity) event.

## How could this be used?

This event could be used to create a custom game mode where players have to hit a certain number of entities to win. It could also be used to detect when you hit a certain entity, and make it be aggresive towards you.

## Fields

<EventsField />

<EntryField name="Entity Type" optional>
    The type of entity that was hit.
</EntryField>
