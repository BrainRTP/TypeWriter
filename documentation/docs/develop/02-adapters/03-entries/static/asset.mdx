# AssetEntry
The AssetEntry is a specialized interface that extends the StaticEntry in the TypeWriter Spigot plugin.
It is primarily used for handling static assets within the game. 
Assets can include various types of files such as images, sounds, or other external resources that are crucial to enhancing the game environment and player experience.
The key attribute of AssetEntry is the path, which specifies the location of the asset.

## Usage
```kotlin
@Entry("example_asset", "An example asset entry.", Colors.PINK, Icons.PERSON_WALKING)
class ExampleAssetEntry(
    override val path: String = "",
): AssetEntry
```

To get the asset from the entry, you can use the following code:
```kotlin
val id = // ID of the entry
val entry = Query.findById<ExampleAssetEntry>(id)
val path = entry.path
```
